On-chain smart contracts will contain cryptographic certificates as proof of verified security. Smart contracts may interact with each other and check for these machine-checkable proofs in order to gain assurances of security. Smart contracts that do not have these verified certificates may require higher fees to transact. Security will be prioritized from the bottom-up. On the base layer is the CertiK Virtual Machine (CVM) , which will undergo Formal Verification to certify the correctness of its implementation. The CertiK Chain will use a verified compiler that assures no bugs are introduced during the transformation of source code into the CVM bytecode. For universal ease-of-use, developers will be able to create smart contracts using the functional programming language, DeepSEA, which has been awarded grants from IBM and The Ethereum Foundation, for integration with Hyperledger Burrow and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) . With DeepSEA, your security is proven within the code itself, backed by a fully certified compiler. With this project, CertiK aims to build a blockchain infrastructure that can provide truly unrivaled end-to-end security. To achieve that, full nodes of CertiK Chain will run on CertiKOS, the world\u2019s first and only fully verified hypervisor / concurrent OS kernel, also developed by CertiK\u2019s co-founders. CertiKOS can work as a military-grade secure enclave and protect CertiK Chain nodes from hacker attacks. Why It Matters \u00b6 To form a safer blockchain ecosystem, security must be built from the ground up. Giving developers and users access to a scalable, intuitive, and safe product encourages long-term adoption, especially for large enterprises. By putting security at the forefront of its development, the CertiK Chain aims to mitigate the security vulnerabilities that have plagued the blockchain world, stifling innovation. In turn, the CertiK Chain will help provide individuals and enterprises with the confidence needed for broader adoption. With the CertiK Chain, we\u2019re proud to take the first step in creating a blockchain that can be trusted, built on, and improved for years to come. CertiK Chain is the key component in CertiK's vision of building end-to-end secure and trustworthy infrastructure for the blockchain world. Here is a brief introduction to the chain. The first version of CertiK Chain is the testnet, which will go through three stages: Closed Alpha Open Beta Full Testnet The overall goal of testnet is to define and implement a majority of the CertiK Chain features and build a strong CertiK Chain developer and user community by providing opportunities to contribute to the chain design and development, to evaluate the chain's main features, and to develop smart contracts and other usage scenarios around the chain. As testnet moves through its various stages, CertiK Foundation expects to provide ample opportunities for active members of the community to be rewarded for their contributions.

TBA \u231b Full Testnet TBA \u231b Closed Alpha \u00b6 The very first stage of testnet is the closed alpha stage, which is the current stage. At the beginning of this stage, most chain features are either not fully tested, partially implemented, or even unimplemented. Hence for this stage we talk about \"what (mostly) works\" rather than \"what does not work\". During this stage, testnet backend and frontend are expected to receive a lot of updates, often causing the chain to be re-deployed from scratch. The validator set size will be small (e.g., no more than 20). The closed alpha stage will last until most testnet features are implemented and alpha-tested. Open Beta \u00b6 The second stage of testnet is the open beta stage. It starts when the closed alpha stage exits with most testnet features implemented and alpha-tested. For this stage we switch to talk about \"what is missing\" instead of \"what works\". During this stage, testnet backend and frontend are expected to receive constant updates, occasionally causing the chain to be re-deployed from scratch. The validator set size will be medium (e.g., no more than 50). The open beta stage will last until all testnet features are implemented and properly tested. Full Testnet \u00b6 The final full stage of testnet starts when the open beta stage exits with all testnet features properly tested. During this stage, testnet backend and frontend are exepcted to receive on-demand updates. Branching instead of re-deployment will be preferred when solving chain divergence. The validator set size will be large (e.g., no more than 100).","title":"What is CertiK Chain"},{"location":"#welcome-to-certik-foundation","text":"","title":"Welcome To CertiK Foundation"},{"location":"#what-is-certik-chain","text":"The CertiK Chain is a public platform based on the CertiK Foundation\u2019s unique Formal Verification security system.

Configuration \u00b6 Prior to Go 1.8, it was required to set a local environment variable called $GOPATH . $GOPATH told the compiler where to find imported third party source code, as well as any local source code you had written. While it is no longer explicitly required, it is still considered a good practice as many third party tools still depend on this variable being set. You can set your $GOPATH by adding the global variables to your ~/.profile. You may want to add this into .zshrc or .bashrc file as per your shell configuration. First, open ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc with nano or your preferred text editor: nano ~/.profile Now you need to setup Go language environment variables for your project. Commonly you need to set 3 environment variables as GOROOT, GOPATH and PATH. GOROOT is the location where Go package is installed on your system. GOPATH is the location of your work directory.

You can create multiple accounts for testing purpose. Please note that the testnet can be restarted often during the alpha testing stage, so you may need to re-create account / re-apply for test tokens on each testnet restart. Convert a Full Node into Validator (important) \u00b6 As CertiK Chain is designed with focus on ultimate blockchain security, one of the security requirements is that all validator nodes must be certified by either CertiK or other approved certifiers . The actual range of validator node certification is not fully defined during the closed alpha stage, but in general CertiK Chain validator nodes are expected to be powerful with good connectivity, use latest official chain node software releases, and eventually run on secure systems software such as CertiKOS (this is unavailable during closed alpha). After creating the full node and completely loading chain history onto it, the current way to get it \"certified\" to be eligible to for validator purpose is the following. First, run below commend on your node instance for obtaining the tendermint pubkey. certikd tendermint show-validator Then send the pubkey to chain@certik.org with title \"request to certify validator node\" and optionally your reasoning on why this node should be approved to become a validator node (typically in terms of capacity, connectivity, maintenance, and security).
